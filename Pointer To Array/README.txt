# Pointer Iteration Over String

This program demonstrates how to:
- Declare a character array (string)
- Use a pointer to iterate through the array
- Advance the pointer with the `++` operator
- Stop at the null terminator (`'\0'`)

The array used is initialized with `"TECNOLOGICO DE MONTERREY"`.  
A pointer is assigned to the first character of the array and advanced until the end of the string.

## Build & Run
```bash
gcc pointer_to_array.c -o pointer_to_array
./pointer_to_array

Example:
