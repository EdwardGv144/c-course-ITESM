# Average of N Numbers (While Loop)

This program demonstrates a counter-controlled `while` loop by computing the average of **N** user-entered numbers.

## How It Works
1. Prompts for `N` (must be a positive integer).
2. Reads `N` numbers in a loop and accumulates their sum.
3. Computes and prints the average with 5 decimal places.

## Build & Run
```bash
gcc average_while.c -o avg
./avg

Example

Program to calculate the average of N numbers
Enter the number of elements to capture -> 6
Enter element [1] -> 7
Enter element [2] -> 4
Enter element [3] -> 5
Enter element [4] -> 1
Enter element [5] -> 9
Enter element [6] -> 5

The average is 5.16667
