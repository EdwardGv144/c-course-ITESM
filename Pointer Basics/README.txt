# Pointer Basics

This program demonstrates the basic use of pointers in C.

## Summary

- Declares an integer `x` with a value of `1024`
- Initializes a pointer `p` to store the address of `x`
- Prints the memory address and value of `x` using both direct access and pointer dereferencing

## Output Example
[0x7ffee69f8b2c] = 1024
[0x7ffee69f8b2c] = 1024


(*Addresses will vary depending on the machine*)

## How to Compile
