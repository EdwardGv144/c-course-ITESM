# Average Calculator (Do-While Loop Example)

This program demonstrates the use of the `do-while` loop in C.

## How It Works
1. Displays an introduction message.
2. Continuously prompts the user to enter an integer.
3. If the entered value is `0`, input ends.
4. Only non-zero entries are included in the average calculation.
5. Displays the average and the count of numbers entered.

## Build & Run
```bash
gcc average_do_while.c -o average
./average

Example:
Program that calculates the average of a list of numbers
Enter 0 to finish
Enter an integer -> 4

Enter an integer -> 6

Enter an integer -> 7

Enter an integer -> 3

Enter an integer -> 8

Enter an integer -> 9

Enter an integer -> 0

The average of the 6 numbers is 6.17
